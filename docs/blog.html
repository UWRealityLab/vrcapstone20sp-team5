					<h2>Week 5 </h2>
					<p>Individual Tasks Finished For MVP</p>
				</header>

				<header>
					<h4>What We've Accomplished</h4>
				</header>
				<p>This week we divided tasks among the team members and finished
					 those tasks for MVP. In specific, each team member is 
					 responsible for the following:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Ryan: Meshing/Environment setup and spawning balls from walls					</li>
					<li>Ana: Setup unity with Magic Leap, ball objects interaction with walls</li>
					<li>Yuxuan: Balls flying in the room and trajectories</li>
					<li>Yating: Scoring system</li>
				</ol>

				<header>
					<h4>Demo</h4>
				</header>

				<ol>
					<li>Path/Ball Spawn and Collision Effects</li>
					<a href="#" class="demo1"><img src="images/path&collision.gif" alt="" /></a>
					
					<li>User Faciliating System: Score & Scan Texts</li>
					<a href="#" class="demo2"><img src="images/score&scan.gif" alt="" /></a>
					
					<li>User Faciliating System: Session Summary</li>
					<a href="#" class="demo3"><img src="images/summary.gif" alt="" /></a>
				
				</ol>
				

				<header>
					<h4>Code Update</h4>
				</header>
				<p>Codes for each task are uploaded into different branches of the repo</p>

				<header>
					<h4>Plans for Next Week</h4>
				</header>
				<p>Now that we have all the parts for MVP, we just need to incorporate those parts together to make a whole game.</p>
				

				<header>
					<h4>Help Needed and Blocked Progress</h4>
				</header>
				<p>Hardware/Software setup problems: </p>
				<ol>
					<li>Unity crash frequently on MacOS;</li>
					<li>Repo does not work for some teammates (asset missing, build failure); </li>
					<li>One teammate has difficulty connect simulator to Unity and has not received ML device yet.</li>
				</ol>

					<h2>Week 4 </h2>
					<p>Setting up Magic Leap, working through tutorials </p>
				</header>

				<header>
					<h4>What We've Accomplished</h4>
				</header>
				<p>This week we connected the Magic Leaps to our computers
					and started learning how to develop for the device.
					We watched a tutorial to get started. 
					Learning how to develop for the magic leap before
					starting our actual app will certainly make development 
					faster later on</p>

				<header>
					<h4>New Release</h4>
				</header>
				<p>No public releases this week</p>

				<header>
					<h4>Code Update</h4>
				</header>
				<p>No development of our app has begun, but we are working on a tutorial to make sure we are able to start soon</p>

				<header>
					<h4>Plans for Next Week</h4>
				</header>
				<p>The biggest goal is starting our actual app and getting a minimum version of the game working. Tasks to be finished next week:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Game Implementation: Get wall/ceiling maps, spawn balls. </li>
					<li>Game Implementation: Show laser paths for balls.</li>
					<li>Game Implementation: Setup timer and score board.</li>
					<li>Add ball disappearing effect if the ball hits any obstacle.</li>
				</ol>

				<header>
					<h4>Help Needed and Blocked Progress</h4>
				</header>
				<p>The only block currently is that one of the team members is still waiting for the magic leap to arrive, making it harder to develop. Hopefully the device will arrive very soon </p>

					<h4>What We've Accomplished</h4>
				</header>
				<p>This week we refined the project idea in the Product Requirements Document and released 
					the initial project pitch video explaining our ideas in the simple graphic/scratch form. 
					The weekly milestones, evaluation metrics, and team member responsibilities are also refined 
					for the next 7 weeks to ensure a smooth development cycle. Refer to the New Release section

					<li>Survival game mode</li>
					<li>Social media, post  high scores</li>
				</ol>

				<header>
					<h4>Plans for Next Week</h4>
				</header>
				<p>The biggest goal for us moving forward is to get a simple scene up a running, and become more familiar with the magic leap development kit. Tasks to be finished next week:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Dev Environment Setup: Setup unity with magic leap.</li>
					<li>Game Implementation: Get wall/ceiling maps, spawn balls. </li>
					<li>Game Implementation: Show laser paths for balls.</li>
				</ol>

				<header>
					<h4>Help Needed and Blocked Progress</h4>
				</header>
				<p>We currently have nothing blocking us, although we anticipate getting help from Joerg in order to help us through the initial setup and the various input modalities (gestures, control, etc.). </p>

						<h2>Weeks 1 + 2</h2>
						<p>Getting Started, Team and Device Setup, Project Requirements </p>
					</header>

					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/blog1banner.jpg" alt="" /></a>

					<header>
						<h4>What We've Accomplished</h4>
					</header>
					<p>This week was anticipated to be slower than others, we spent a lot of time getting familiar with the course structure, our magic leap devices, and the development kits necessary to begin developing. The biggest thing we accomplished, as expected, was deciding on our project idea. We were initially interested in designing a medical exam, but ultimately decided that our knowledge and technical expertise would limit us there. Instead, we’ve decided to design a fitness game in hopes that it can help people stay engaged and active during these unusual times.</p>
					<p>The current idea is to have users run around and collect balls falling from the sky in a timely fashion, while avoiding obstacles. It will be great exercise for the users legs, neck, and cardiovascular system as they are constantly moving, reacting, and changing directions. Depending on the difficulty of implementation, we plan to add more features or other fitness style mini-games.</p>
					<p>Beyond the actual project idea, we’ve set up a slack channel and a google drive folder which houses all our documents. Working remotely has posed to be more difficult than expected, but we will begin to utilize more virtual zoom meetings in order to stay on the same page and delegate tasks as efficiently as possible.</p>

					<header>
						<h4>Code Update</h4>
					</header>
					<p>No actual development has begun, although we anticipate to begin within
                        the next week.</p>

					<header>
						<h4>Ideas Update</h4>
					</header>
					<p>Here are the main elements we’ve begun to consider for our game:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Different game modes and objectives: One mode could be to collect as
                            many items as possible during some time frame, another could be to collect as many items without catching a bomb.</li>
						<li>Game objects with varying properties: Some will fall and disappear
                            through the floor, while others will bounce around with different speeds and directions. Even something like the golden snitch could be a great addition.</li>
						<li>Various obstacles: We already mentioned bombs, but other things like
                            black holes, items to avoid, and terrain to traverse will both increase the difficulty and physical activity of the game.</li>
						<li>Game props: We want to have power ups or props that give the player
                            special abilities like doubling their score, slowing down time, or clearing all objects in the scene.</li>
						<li>Musical elements: Certain block types will have certain sounds, there
                            may be background music, and some sort of indicator for a new record or even winning the game.</li>
						<li>Visual effects: This will help attract the players to certain
                            objectives. For example, if an object hits the ground it could have a splash effect, or display a “-1” text.</li>
                        <li>Varying game environments: The game could either be set up on the
                            ground or in the sea. If it were to be in the sea, the items would float when they hit the water. We could even have a sports court to reinforce the fitness aspect of the game.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>The biggest goal for us moving forward is to get a simple scene up a running, and become more familiar with the magic leap development kit. Tasks to be finished next week:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Environment setup: explore how to deploy the app to our devices or set up an emulator on our computers for debugging and testing purposes. </li>
                        <li>Mentoring & Planning: figure out who is familiar with the features we want in our game and can help us establish a clear plan for development as the four of us haven’t done much AR development up to this point. </li>
                        <li>Resource/Asset Discovery: Explore and gather some prebuilt assets (eg. scene, objects, animations, user interaction) that could be used in the game. If possible, use the assets to build a simple scene and identify the possible tech/non-tech challenges we need to solve in the future.</li>
                    </ol>
